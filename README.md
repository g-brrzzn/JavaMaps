# JavaMaps

This Java project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing and navigating a city graph. The graph represents cities connected by roads, where each road has an associated distance and toll cost. The project allows users to add and remove cities and roads, and to find the shortest or cheapest path between any two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.
